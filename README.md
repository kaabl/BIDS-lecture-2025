# Bio-image Data Science

This repository contains training resources for Students at Uni Leipzig who want to dive into bio-image data science with Python. 
Corresponding PPTx files can be found [on zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15182562).

## Teaching Goal

Students learn the full workflow of common bio-image data
science projects to a degree that they can execute a scientific
data analysis project in this context on their own. They will be
familiar with common bio-image analysis algorithms and
workflows, how to choose them according to a scientific goal,
and how to measure quality of derived results. Attending the
lecture and executing the practicals qualifies the students to
work as bio-image data scientist in the pharmaceutical industry
or basic biological research.

## Assignments

As explained in the lecture on May 9th, every enrolled student has to submit an image analysis workflow + documentation. The workflows are intended to process different datasets. Each student gets their own dataset. Download the zipfile corresponding to your MatNr and unzip it. The password was given to you in the lecture on May 9th.
