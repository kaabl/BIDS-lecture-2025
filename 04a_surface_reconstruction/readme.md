# Surface reconstruction

To do surface reconstruction in Napari, we need to install additional plugins packages, such as [vedo](https://vedo.embl.es/) and [napari-process-points-and-surfaces](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces/):

```
conda install vedo "numpy<2" -c conda-forge
```
