# GPU accelerated image processing

As we work often with three-dimensional image data, potentially over time, classical image processing takes quite some time. 

Hence, we will dive into image processing on graphics processing units (GPUs) using [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/), [pyopencl](https://documen.tician.de/pyopencl/), [pyclesperanto](https://github.com/clesperanto/pyclesperanto).
This technology allows us to process images faster, GPU accelerated.
Note that classical algorithms and GPU-accelerated implementations may differ in the very details.
